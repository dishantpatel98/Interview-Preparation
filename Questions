1)On what does the sizeof pointer depends?
-->Size of pointer depends on the compiler wether it is 32bit or 64bit.
For Example if compiler is 32bit then the compiler can access 2^32 locations.i.e ie it cna store
the data in 2^32 locations.Now the size of pointer should be such that it should access all of these locations.
So the size of pointer has to be 32bits.Hence the size of pointer is compiler dependent.

2)What is the meaning of 32/64bit processor?
-->It means that the data bus is 32/64 bits wide.Hence processor can fetch 32/64 bits in one memory operation
or one CPU cycles.Also word size is processor dependent.If the processsor is 32 bit the word size is also 32bits.
32 bit software can run of 64bit machine but viceversa is not true.
